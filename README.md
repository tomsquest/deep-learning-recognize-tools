This project was done during the Fast.ai course, using the `resnet34` model.

## Fast.ai Course

[Practical Deep Learning for Coders by Fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/)

The course is exciting. Lots of learning, and hands-on practice. I recommend it!

## Demo

See the [Demo website](https://ai.tomsquest.com/projects/recognize-tools)

## Notebook
